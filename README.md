# CodeAlpha_task1-Web-Scraping-in-Data-Analytics
This project demonstrates how web scraping can be used to collect, clean, and analyze real-world data from the web for data-driven insights.
Using Python and popular libraries like BeautifulSoup, Requests, and Pandas, the project extracts structured data from unstructured web sources and applies exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques.

🚀 Project Overview

Objective: Automate the process of data collection from websites and perform analytics for decision-making.

Data Source: Public websites (e.g., e-commerce, news, job listings, or sports statistics).

Methodology:

Fetch HTML content using requests.

Parse data using BeautifulSoup.

Store structured data in CSV / Excel / Database.

Perform data cleaning and EDA using Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib/Seaborn.

Visualize insights with charts and graphs.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python

BeautifulSoup / Requests / Selenium (for scraping)

Pandas / NumPy (for data manipulation)

Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly (for visualization)

📊 Example Use Cases

Scraping job postings to analyze demand for skills.

Collecting product prices & ratings for market research.

Extracting news headlines for sentiment analysis.

Compiling sports statistics for performance trends.
